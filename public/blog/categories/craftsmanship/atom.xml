<p>It's easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of projects and deadlines and forget that software development is very much a craft that needs to be practiced. The complex requirements and external pressures of a production application often cloud our judgement, forcing us to forgo the fundamental concepts that create great software. It is useful to step away from the code you work on day-to-day to focus on honing your skills merely for the sake of improving as a developer.
