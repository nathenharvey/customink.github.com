    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://technology.customink.com/images/stoplight.png"><img src="http://technology.customink.com/images/stoplight.png" width="300" style="float:right; margin:0 0 15px 15px;" /></a>
At CustomInk, we use a variety of tools to monitor the status of our builds. One such tool was <a href="https://github.com/customink-webops/greenscreen">Greenscreen</a>. In fact, we even wrote <a href="http://technology.customink.com/blog/2012/01/02/green-screen/">a blog post about how we use Greenscreen at CustomInk</a> not too long ago.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems with Greenscreen was its extensibility. By default, Greenscreen only works with Hudson and Jenkins servers. With <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> becoming quite popular in the open-source community, Greenscreen needed a major upgrade. Furthermore, Greenscreen was not very extensible.</p>

<p>After some significant refactoring, Greenscreen evolved into <a href="https://github.com/customink/stoplight">Stoplight</a>...</p>

<h2>Significant Improvements</h2>

<p>There are a number of improvements in Stoplight. These are the most critical or useful to the end-user:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for multiple (any) continuous integration server</li>
<li>Highly configurable yaml files</li>
<li>Cross-browser beautiful UI</li>
<li>More informative build statuses</li>
<li>Extensibility</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Full test suite</li>
</ul>


<h2>Refactoring</h2>

<p>Originally, I was just going to add Travis CI support to Greenscreen. However, I quickly asked myself, "why stop at Travis CI?"; we should allow developers to connect Greenscreen to any continuous integration server. After cleaning up the code a bit, I introduced the concept of a <code>Provider</code>. Simply put, a <code>Provider</code> is an abstract Ruby class that maps server-data into Greenscreen data. It looks like this:</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>Provider is an abstract class that all providers inherit from. It requires that a specified format be returned. This way, stoplight</h1>

<h1>doesn't care who it's talking to, as long as it guarantees certain information.</h1>

<p>module Stoplight::Providers
  class Provider</p>

<pre><code>attr_reader :options, :response

# Initializes a hash `@options` of default options
def initialize(options = {})
  ...
end

# `projects` must return an array of Stoplight::Project
# see Stoplight::Project for more information on the spec
def projects
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>On the front-end, now we don't have to worry about parsing different server responses; we know that any provider will respond to the <code>Provider#projects</code> instance method. This makes refactoring our front-end code much easier.</p>

<p>The <code>Stoplight::Project</code> clearly defines a schema and method-set that must be adhered to. In the front-end, we can simply call <code>.projects</code> on any provider and know with 100% certainty that the given objects respond to a certain set of methods. Those methods are defined in the <code>Stoplight::Project</code> class:</p>

<p>```ruby
module Stoplight
  class Project</p>

<pre><code>attr_accessor :name, :build_url, :last_build_id, :last_build_time, :last_build_status, :current_status

# Initialize (new) takes in a hash of options in the following format:
#
# {
#   :name =&gt; 'my_project',
#   :build_url =&gt; 'http://ci.jenkins.org/job/my_project',
#   :web_url =&gt; 'http://github.com/username/my_project', # optional
#   :last_build_id =&gt; '7',
#   :last_build_time =&gt; '2012-05-24T03:19:53Z',
#   :last_build_status =&gt; 0,
#   :current_status =&gt; 1,
# }
#
# - `name` - the name of this project
# - `build_url` - the url where the build came from
# - `build_id` - the unique build_id for this project
# - `last_build_time` - last successful build
# - `last_build_status` - integer representing the exit code of the last build:
#   - -1: unknown
#   -  0: passed (success)
#   -  1: failed (error, failure)
# - `current_status` - the current status of the build:
#   - -1: unknwon
#   -  0: done (sleeping, waiting)
#   -  1: building (building, working, compiling)
def initialize(options = {})
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
<code>``
This set of simple instructions tells a provider how it must format data. Essentially this makes</code>Provider` a micro-data-mapper, massaging data from remote APIs into a standard format. Stoplight then uses that standard format to create a unified user experience.</p>

<h3>Adding Tests</h3>

<p>Since Stoplight is destined to become an open-source project, it needs a comprehensive test suite. Furthermore, during our refactoring, it's important that we don't break existing functionality. As such, I added a full test suite with RSpec. To make development easier, I also use Spork, Guard, and Growl-Ruby to automatically run tests in the background while I'm coding. This makes TDD much more exciting.</p>

<h3>Foreman</h3>

<p>With all those dependencies, plus running the server, it only made sense to use <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">Foreman</a> to manage all those processes. What used to be (in three different terminal tabs):</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec shotgun -p 4567
bundle exec compass watch -c config/compass.rb
bundle exec guard
</code></pre>

<p>simply became:</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec foreman start
</code></pre>

<p>with a tiny <code>Procfile</code>:</p>

<p><code>
web:      shotgun -p 4567
compass:  compass watch -c config/compass.rb
guard:    guard
</code></p>

<h3>Compass</h3>

<p>Under the hood, all the styles for Stoplight are generated by a framework called <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a>. Compass allows us to leverage the power of SCSS and easily create a cross-browser compliant application. Stoplight uses Compass and SCSS for all it's styles. This ensures a consistent user experience.</p>

<h3>ABAP Text</h3>

<p>ABAP stands for "As Big As Possible". A tiny snippet of jQuery dynamically sizes text to fit in its bounds. Whether you're displaying on a 60" LED TV or a 13" Monitor, the text will be as big and clear as possible.</p>

<h3>Adding Travis</h3>

<p>Brace yourself for a meta-moment. Since I wanted Stoplight to become a popular open-source project, I added the build on Travis CI. With <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/customink/stoplight">Stoplight on Travis CI</a> we can use Stoplight to monitor the build status of Stoplight.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There you have it! What was once a very isolated and less-than-configurable tool is now highly extensible and open to contributions by the community. If you are currently using Greenscreen or another build monitoring alternative, give Stoplight a try.</p>

<h2>I Want it!</h2>

<p>Stoplight is available for <a href="https://github.com/customink/stoplight">download and forking on github</a>. Pull requests are greatly welcome! There is also a highly-configurable <a href="https://github.com/customink-webops/stoplight">chef cookbook for installing Stoplight</a> on Apache and Passenger on your own servers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://railsconf2012.com/">RailsConf 2012</a>, I gave a presentation on how our web operations team enables developer productivity.</p>

<p>There's always a bit of tension when getting features from idea to production. In this talk, I describe some of the changes CustomInk has made to reduce this friction and keep the new features coming. Gone are the days of bi-monthly deploys, office pools dedicated to guessing when this deploy will be rolled back, and the ceremony surrounding the deploy-rollback-fix-deploy cycle. Today, ideas flow from product managers to developers to production with ease thanks to a number of changes that we've made to our teams, processes and tools.</p>

<p>Presenting at RailsConf was a really enjoyable experience and the presentation was well received.  There were lots of questions from the audience after the presentation.  Unfortunately, the Q &amp; A section was not captured in the video.  I'd really appreciate any questions or feedback you have, just drop a comment below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/customink/greenscreen">Green Screen</a> is a build monitoring tool that is designed to be used as a dynamic Big Visible Chart (BVC) in your work area. It lets you add links to your build servers and displays the largest possible information on a monitor so that the team can see the build status from anywhere in the room.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/greenscreen.jpg" width="300" height="225" title="Green Screen Monitor" alt="Green Screen Monitor">
We use Green Screen at <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a> to look after our continuous integration servers, currently 3 Hudson servers and one Jenkins cluster. We have a monitor mounted in the engineering office that makes it easy for everyone to quickly assess the build status.</p>

<p>Green Screen is a simple Sinatra application that is <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/deploying-green-screen">easy to configure and deploy</a>.  It works well with any continuous integration server that conforms to the <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CI/Multiple+Project+Summary+Reporting+Standard">multiple project summary reporting standard</a>.</p>

<p>You can see a sample Green Screen app running at <a href="http://greenscreenapp.com">http://greenscreenapp.com</a>.  Be forewarned, this sample Green Screen looks at all of the builds currently running on <a href="http://ci.jenkins-ci.org">http://ci.jenkins-ci.org</a>.  This is fine for demo purposes but you may find it to be a bit overwhelming since it's <strong>over 300 builds</strong> at the time of this writing.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Green Screen was originally implemented by <a href="https://github.com/martinjandrews">Marty Andrews</a> and <a href="http://blog.martyandrews.net/2009/08/greenscreen-build-monitor-bvc.html">announced on his blog in 2009</a>. In the original version, a build that was in progress would blink on the screen.
<a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4565_building.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4565_building.jpg" width="208" height="145" title="martinjandrews Green Screen" alt="martinjandrews Green Screen"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rsutphin">Rhett Sutphin</a> improved the layout of green screen and introduced a new color, yellow, for builds that are in progress.
<a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4566-building.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4566-building.jpg" width="207" height="145" title="rsutphin Green Screen" alt="rsutphin Green Screen"></a></p>

<p>After using these versions for a while at CustomInk, we decided that the most important thing to know was which builds were failing. Once you get past a handful of builds, it's no longer very interesting to see every build. We forked Rhett's version and created a <a href="https://github.com/customink/greenscreen">new layout for Green Screen</a>.</p>

<p>If everything is passing, the screen is basically one giant checkmark.</p>

<p><a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/green.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/green.jpg" width="210" height="119" title="customink Green Screen" alt="customink Green Screen"></a></p>

<p>If there are any failing builds, they're shown in the main area while all others are displayed on the right.</p>

<p><a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567.jpg" width="210" height="121" title="customink failed build" alt="customink failed build"></a></p>

<p>Finally, a build that previously failed will be shown in yellow while it's rebuilding.</p>

<p><a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567_building.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567_building.jpg" width="210" height="121" title="customink building" alt="customink building">
</a>
We've also added support for controlling which builds are displayed from each CI server. So that you can explicitly include or exclude builds or just go with the default behavior of showing all builds on the server.</p>
