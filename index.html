At CustomInk, we use a variety of tools to monitor the status of our builds. One such tool was <a href="https://github.com/customink-webops/greenscreen">Greenscreen</a>. In fact, we even wrote <a href="http://technology.customink.com/blog/2012/01/02/green-screen/">a blog post about how we use Greenscreen at CustomInk</a> not too long ago.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems with Greenscreen was its extensibility. By default, Greenscreen only works with Hudson and Jenkins servers. With <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> becoming quite popular in the open-source community, Greenscreen needed a major upgrade. Furthermore, Greenscreen was not very extensible.</p>

<p>After some significant refactoring, Greenscreen evolved into <a href="https://github.com/customink/stoplight">Stoplight</a>&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the big themes that emerged during <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com/">#ChefConf</a> was that we should be testing our infrastructure code.  Software engineers have been practicing test-driven development, behavior-driven development, continuous integration, and many other testing-related practices for a long time.  It&#8217;s becoming more important for the infrastructure engineers to learn from and apply these practices to our day-to-day workflow.  When it comes to testing Chef-driven infrastructure automation, there are a number of tools and practices that are starting to emerge.  In this article I&#8217;ll look at a &#8220;minimum viable testing&#8221; (MVT) approach to this problem using <a href="http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/">Foodcritic</a> and <a href="http://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>.  <a href="http://technology.customink.com/blog/2012/06/04/mvt-foodcritic-and-travis-ci/#steps">Follow the steps in this article</a> to get your public cookbooks tested after every <code>git push</code>.</p>

<h3>Testing with Chef</h3>

<p>The idea of building automated tests for your infrastructure code has been getting a lot of traction lately.  When it comes to <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>, many tools are starting to emerge.</p>

<p>The first tool in this area to get any significant traction, that I know of, was <a href="http://www.cucumber-chef.org/">cucumber-chef</a>.  I first learned of this tool when I saw a pre-release copy of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020042.do">Test-Driven Infrastructure with Chef</a> at the O&#8217;Reilly booth at <a href="http://velocityconf.com/velocity2011">Velocity Conf 2011</a>.  <a href="http://twitter.com/lordcope">Stephen Nelson-Smith</a>, the book&#8217;s author and framework&#8217;s lead developer, proposes an outside-in approach to testing where your tests can also act as monitors that look after the health of your infrastructure.  I like the idea of this approach and feel it makes a lot of sense in a greenfield environment.  One benefit of this approach is that it blurs the line between testing and monitoring.  You can easily hook-up your monitoring system to your cucumber tests.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/acrmp/chefspec">ChefSpec</a> is another tool for testing your Chef code.  It is a gem that makes it easy to write <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> examples for Chef cookbooks.  This style of testing allows you to execute your tests without needing to converge the node that your tests are running on.  In other words, you can execute your tests without needing to provision a server.  One huge appeal to this style of testing is that the feedback loop is very small.  You&#8217;ll get feedback about your cookbook changes within seconds or a very few minutes of saving your changes.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/calavera/minitest-chef-handler">Minitest Chef Handler</a> is yet another tool for testing with Chef.  This runs a suite of <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">minitest</a> tests as a report handler in your Chef-managed nodes.  As you may know, report handlers are run at the end of each <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Anatomy+of+a+Chef+Run">chef run, or convergence</a>.</p>

<h3>Testing at ChefConf</h3>

<p>At the inaugural <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com">#ChefConf</a> there were many sessions that included information about many companies&#8217; approach to testing.  Here&#8217;s a quick list of some of the sessions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/04/episode-10-testallthethings-testing.html">Food Fight Show Episode #10 - TESTALLTHETHINGS</a> &#8211; This wasn&#8217;t actually part of #ChefConf but is &#8216;required listening&#8217; for anyone interested in learning more about this space.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/atomic-penguin/ntp">NTP Cookbook with tests</a> - tests were added to this cookbook as part of the hackday event.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have ever tried to follow the <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Getting+Started">Opscode Getting Started Guide for Chef</a>, you&#8217;ll quickly be overtaken by Chef jargon, confusing instructions, many assumptions, and no clear direction. Even the most experienced developers had a difficult time following the Opscode Wiki. While it serves as a great reference resource, you pretty much have to know Chef before it is of any use.</p>

<p>In Part 1 of this 2-part series, we will walk through setting up the Chef environment on your local machine. In Part 2, we will demonstrate how to provision your personal laptop using Chef.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first started working with Chef, there were a couple of areas that I knew were going to be really awesome and helpful but I wasn&#8217;t sure how to get started with them.  In this presentation, I&#8217;ll provide a quick introduction to five things you&#8217;ve always wanted to know about Chef but were afraid to ask.</p>

<p>I gave this presentation at <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com">#ChefConf 2012</a>.</p>

<p>Level-up your Chef skills by learning about these areas of Chef:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Attribute Precedence</strong> - Role, environment, cookbook, data bag? Which attribute value will be used in my chef run?</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Databags</strong> - Chef 0.10 brought us encrypted databags. We&#8217;ll look at how to create and use databags and how to keep them up-to-date in your repository.</li>
<li><strong>LWRP</strong> - What is a LWRP? How and why do you create one? We&#8217;ll look at a couple of sample LWRPs and learn how to build a simple one.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handlers</strong> - Demystify exception and report handlers by writing a simple one and seeing examples of how they work in the wild.</li>
<li><strong>Capistrano and Chef</strong> - Take a quick look at why and how to integrate Chef search into your Capistrano configuration to make deploying your Rails apps even easier.</li>
</ul>


<p>One thing I didn&#8217;t mention in the presentation was how to use the data from the encrypted data bag.  I&#8217;ve updated the slides to include this info but it doesn&#8217;t appear in the video.  In any case, here&#8217;s a quick demo of how you might use it:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You&#8217;ve heard of Chef, Puppet, and other frameworks that can help you build out your infrastructure. You&#8217;ve been meaning to play around with one or more of them for some time now. Now&#8217;s your chance; Start cooking up on your own servers!</p>

<p>In this presentation, I provide an introduction to Chef with a focus on what you&#8217;ll need to know to get a Rails application up and running.</p>

<p>Topics include:
  * Introduction to Chef
  * Nodes, roles, environments, and other terminology
  * Introduction to cookbooks
  * Provisioning an environment for a Rails application
  * Deploying with Capistrano</p>

<p>You won&#8217;t be ready to compete in Iron Chef, but you will be ready to serve up your own Rails environment in no time.</p>

<p>I gave slightly different versions of this presentation at <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/">RubyNation 2012</a> and <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com">#ChefConf 2012</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d really appreciate any comments, questions, or feedback in the comments section below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At <a href="http://railsconf2012.com/">RailsConf 2012</a>, I gave a presentation on how our web operations team enables developer productivity.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s always a bit of tension when getting features from idea to production. In this talk, I describe some of the changes CustomInk has made to reduce this friction and keep the new features coming. Gone are the days of bi-monthly deploys, office pools dedicated to guessing when this deploy will be rolled back, and the ceremony surrounding the deploy-rollback-fix-deploy cycle. Today, ideas flow from product managers to developers to production with ease thanks to a number of changes that we&#8217;ve made to our teams, processes and tools.</p>

<p>Presenting at RailsConf was a really enjoyable experience and the presentation was well received.  There were lots of questions from the audience after the presentation.  Unfortunately, the Q &amp; A section was not captured in the video.  I&#8217;d really appreciate any questions or feedback you have, just drop a comment below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week the CustomInk Tech team welcomed two new interns, Nolan Carroll and Seth Vargo.  Nolan and Seth are joining us for the summer from Carnegie Mellon University where they are both majoring in Information Systems.</p>

<p>Nolan and Seth wasted no time hopping on our <a href="/blog/2012/05/14/welcome-josh-born">deploy train</a> last week, but they couldn&#8217;t have done it without the help of our (semi) automated build process.  A while ago, Nathen Harvey talked about our <a href="/blog/2012/01/02/green-screen/">Green Screen</a> build monitor.  While this serves as a great motivator for us to keep our builds passing, the ability for us to quickly create builds for any branch is what keeps us moving fast.</p>

<p>Using some home grown capistrano scripts, any developer can easily create and manage an automated Jenkins build, which will automatically be monitored by Green Screen.  A developer&#8217;s typical workflow might look something like:</p>

<p>Now that a new feature branch is available in our remote repository, the developer can create and start their own Jenkins build:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">cap</span> <span class="n">jenkins</span><span class="ss">:create</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;ve created rfe_new_feature.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">cap</span> <span class="n">jenkins</span><span class="ss">:build</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;ve found rfe_new_feature and it&#39;s building now.&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now a build is running on our Jenkins server.  More importantly, Jenkins will use it&#8217;s Jedi powers to detect any changes to the remote branch and automatically kick off a new build.  When builds fail, the entire team is notified and Green Screen turns red.  We have a handful of other useful Jenkins tasks as well:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="n">cap</span> <span class="n">jenkins</span><span class="ss">:build</span>     <span class="c1"># Kicks off a build for the current branch</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Continuous deployment can&#8217;t happen without automation.  I&#8217;d like to give a big shout out to our Web Ops team for driving us down the automation super highway.  I&#8217;d also like to extend a warm welcome to Nolan and Seth, we look forward to seeing their builds pass all summer long.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>One Saturday dedicated to honing your craft</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of projects and deadlines and forget that software development is very much a craft that needs to be practiced. The complex requirements and external pressures of a production application often cloud our judgement, forcing us to forgo the fundamental concepts that create great software.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s useful to step away from the code you work on day-to-day to focus on honing your skills merely for the sake of improving as a developer. Corey Haines&#8217; <a href="http://coderetreat.org">Coderetreat</a> format facilitates this by strongly suggesting its participants delete their code immediately after each session. By the end of the day, the value created is not the code that is written, but the skills and insights learned from writing that code.</p>

<p>The Coderetreat consisted of five 45 minute pairing sessions building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway&#8217;s Game of Life</a>. The &#8216;zero-player&#8217; game is a form of cellular automata that consists of a grid of dead or alive &#8216;cells&#8217; represented by the squares in the grid. Based on a set of four simple rules, the grid comes to life with complex patterns and interactions between the cells.</p>

<p>The rules are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>


<p>With just a simple initial configuration of cells, patterns like Gosper&#8217;s Glider Gun can be made:</p>

<p><img src="/images/gospers_glider_gun.gif" alt="Gosper's Glider Gun" /></p>

<p>Rules and image taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway&#8217;s Game of Life Wikipedia Article</a></p>

<h3>Session One</h3>

<p>For the first session, I worked with another developer to build up &#8216;Cell&#8217; object using CoffeeScript and Jasmine. It went well, but about half way into the session, the requirements of the game were changed to include zombie cells that come to life based on its own set of rules. We were asked about the impact of introducing these new requirements into our code. We were largely unaffected by the change due to not being very far into the implementation, but it was obvious to see how we could have been bitten by the change.</p>

<p>We chose to deal with alive and dead cells through a boolean attribute on the Cell class. Had we fleshed out the game more, our logic and objects would be tightly bound to this concept and introducing a third state would require considerable time and effort.</p>

<p>Thus, the stage was set for the remaining sessions. We would learn how to better build software that can bend and mold to the often changing demands of the real world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The CustomInk technology team wants to extend a warm welcome to our newest member, Josh Born.  Josh wasted no time and hopped onto the deploy train today for his first production release.</p>

<p>At CustomInk we like to <a href="http://www.customink.com/designs/proofs/jub0-000p-fxs7/front.jpg" target="_new">continuously deploy</a> changes to our site.  This means no sprints, no iterations, no milestones.  We work, and when we are satisfied with our work, we deploy it.  On average, engineers deploy updates to our site about five to seven times a day.</p>

<p>We like to manage our deployments in a very low fidelity way, which was inspired largely by the engineers at Etsy.  We call it the &#8220;deploy train&#8221; and it&#8217;s nothing more then a virtual line managed by our campfire topic.</p>

<p><img src="/images/deploy_train.png" alt="Campfire Deploy Train" /></p>

<p>When you are ready to deploy a change, you add yourself to the end of the deploy train and simply wait for your turn.  The responsibility of the engineer at the front of the deploy train is to merge, deploy, and verify his or her changes in production.  When the engineer is satisfied, they take themselves off the list and notify the next engineer in line that it is their turn.</p>

<p><img src="/images/josh_born_ponder_deploy.jpg" alt="Josh ponders his first release" /></p>

<p>This will be the first of many deploys for Josh.  We are very excited to have him on board and look forward to his next release, sometime later this week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most common production issues I run into are missing indexes.  The other day I got to thinking that they are usually missing because of the evolution of the software.</p>

<p>We might use some rails generators to prototype some basic functionality.  Then we&#8217;ll iterate over a set of stories incorporating new behavior.  Maybe we&#8217;ll do some refactoring, scrap some features, pull out some dead code and &#8220;harden&#8221; some areas we&#8217;ve identified as brittle.  But we almost never analyze the &#8220;data model&#8221; before we deploy.</p>

<p>Have we considered our data access patterns?  Did we create foreign keys to enforce data integrity?  Do we have any idea how big these tables are going to grow?  We almost certainly don&#8217;t need to shard them…do we?</p>

<p>No, we almost never do this.</p>

<p>Instead we race to ship.  &#8221;<a href="http://www.customink.com/lab/?cid=jub0-000p-fxs7#shared">Deploy early, deploy often</a>&#8221; is our motto, and we love it.  Deploying code is awesome, it means people are going to use it.  People using our code makes us happy because it means we didn&#8217;t waste our time today.  We did something real that people got to use.</p>

<p>A few months down the road comes the tipping point.  One of your tables amasses a few hundred thousand rows.  Your pages start to take seconds to load because your queries take seconds to run.  Your database connections are tied up, and when your site gets enough traffic, things start to fall over.</p>

<p>This literally just happened to us.  Again.  We missed one little index on one little foreign key in one little table.  And then one of our database servers stopped responding.   Spiked CPU, connections maxed out, alerts firing, then fail over.</p>

<p>While Rails makes it really easy to create models without even thinking about the database, Rails also makes it very easy to deal with the database.  In James Edward Gray&#8217;s talk <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/jeg2/p/10-things-you-didnt-know-rails-could-do?utm_source=rubyweekly&amp;utm_medium=email">10 Things You Didn&#8217;t Know Rails Could Do</a> he shows you how to use rails migration generators to create your table AND index your fields.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t like generators, you can simply use the &#8216;add_index&#8217; method in the migration itself:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CreateFoo</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Migration</span>

</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">integer</span> <span class="ss">:foreign_key</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span>  <span class="ss">:other_valuable_data</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">add_index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:foos</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:foreign_key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;foos_foreign_key&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Of course, if you don&#8217;t think to add the index when you created the table, you can always create a migration just to add the index.  The key is adding a checkpoint to your development process in which you analyze your data structures for completeness.  Adding this checkpoint gives you a chance to add any missing database constructs before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
