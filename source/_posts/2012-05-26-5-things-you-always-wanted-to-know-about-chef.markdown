When I first started working with Chef, there were a couple of areas that I knew were going to be really awesome and helpful but I wasn't sure how to get started with them.  In this presentation, I'll provide a quick introduction to five things you've always wanted to know about Chef but were afraid to ask.  

Level-up your Chef skills by learning about these areas of Chef: 

* **Attribute Precedence** - Role, environment, cookbook, data bag? Which attribute value will be used in my chef run? 
* **Encrypted Databags** - Chef 0.10 brought us encrypted databags. We'll look at how to create and use databags and how to keep them up-to-date in your repository. 
* **LWRP** - What is a LWRP? How and why do you create one? We'll look at a couple of sample LWRPs and learn how to build a simple one. 
* **Error Handlers** - Demystify exception and report handlers by writing a simple one and seeing examples of how they work in the wild. 
* **Capistrano and Chef** - Take a quick look at why and how to integrate Chef search into your Capistrano configuration to make deploying your Rails apps even easier.
