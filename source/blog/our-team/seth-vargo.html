Seth Vargo is the Web Operators intern for <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a>. Seth is currently an undergraduate <a href="http://is.hss.cmu.edu/">Information Systems</a> major at <a href="http://cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. Seth is an avid Ruby developer, <a href="http://github.com/sethvargo">github</a> lover, <a href="http://twitter.com/sethvargo">Twitter</a> fanatic, open-source proponent, <a href="http://dribbble.com">dribbble</a> gawker, and run-on sentence creator. In his spare time, Seth enjoys food, soccer, xbox, and doing incredibly nerdy things with electronics (like <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino and <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>). I really enjoy learning new things, especially when those things are nerdy or bleeding-edge.
